We are treating the reward as something internal to the agent, as oposed to the effect, which is something he receives from the world. The idea here is that different rewards can determine different behaviours for the agent in the same world, so we are viewing this as a change in the agent itself. Techinically the reward is a function from an effect to a float(we will denote this as $R_0$), however we will usually think of the function bellow when we are talking about rewards:\n",

    "## Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "The solutions we will go through in this project involve learning a good policy $\\pi$. This is usually done through a process called GPI, where we simultaneasly improving estimates for a $Q$ function and improving the policy $\\pi$ based on this function. Since the police keeps changing as we go, the $Q$ function we will be updating isn't necessarily approximating a particular value function $Q_\\pi$(especially because we don't what is the policy we are trying to achieve in the first place), nevertheless this is done in a smart way where we can get to good policies. Some details are povided in the specific notebooks, but to better understand what is going in GPI I highly recommend reading  [\"Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction\"](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf).\n",

It has a drawback though, we need to know a model of the world! So as great as it is, in some cases it just presuposes too much knowledge about the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we think about it, having a model of the world should indeed be enough to find an optimal solution. This doesn't mean that it is easy to find this solution, and having an algorithm capable of doing so is great. Our goal in the DP section is to explore such solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploration based methods\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a group of methods that I am calling \"exploration\" based methods. By these I mean any algorithm that resorts on a process like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "* an agent interacts with a world by taking actions and completing episodes\n",
    "* it uses the information it gathers from these events to improve its policy\n",
    "\n",
    "This is different in an essential way, as the agent is not given information on how the world works beforehand; it has to \"go out there\" and collect this information itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "The actions the agent takes during an episode affect both the returns it gets and the data it collects. This leads to a situation called the \"exploration vs exploitation\", where the agent will have to decide whether he wants to stay in what he believes is the best path, or go exploring for new information.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many solutions that fall under this group, including Monte Carlo methods and all variations of TD learning."
