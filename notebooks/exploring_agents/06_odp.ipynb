    "By keeping a proper map of what has been explored, and using our knowledge of the world physics, we manage to get a more efficient algorithm in our \"Q-explorer\". Here we will take this to another level, and try to solve the problem as efficiently as we can. Just as with Q-explorer **we will assume a deterministic setting for this agent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we think about the problem at hand, it is pretty clear that the agent is not exploring in an efficient way. For instance, if we already managed to traverse our world in $n$ steps, then why should the agent care to explore any state that is at a $n+1$ distance(or greater) from the origin? any path going throw such state will necessarily be longer. More generally we should want our agent only to consider going throw states that can lead to shorter paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may seem that this would lead to a very complicated exploration policy, however we can use our dynamic programming tools, to make this a really simple problem. Supose the agent has already completed a run of the world, so he know where the final state is, as well as some of the walls and traps. This agent can generate an \"optimistic\" map of the world, i.e. a map where each unknown state is considered to be empty(which is the best case sceneario for us), and then use this map and dynamic programming to \"plan\" a route to the final state. This route is the best possible route we can have, with the only caviat that it may not work, since while traversing this route the agent can hit a wall or a trap whenever it enters an unvisited state. However whenever this happens the agent can simply update his map and his policy(again by using dynamic programming). Here is an outline of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> <ul>\n",
    ">   <li> use a generic exploration policy to complete a first run of the world, and generate a map(wchich may be incomplete) </li>\n",
    ">   <li> use dynamic programming to determine a greedy policy in our map; unknown states are set as empty(the \"optimistic\" assumption) </li>\n",
    ">   <li> loop until agent passes an episode without incidents </li>\n",
    ">   <ul style=\"padding-bottom: 0;\">\n",
    ">        <li> follow the policy. If something \"unexpected\" happens(i.e. we encounter a state different from what we have in the \"optmistic\" map): </li>\n",
    ">        <ul style=\"padding-bottom: 1;\">\n",
    ">            <li> update map </li>\n",
    ">            <li> use dynamic programming to update policy </li>\n",

    ">    </ul>\n",
    "> </ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This a somewhat simple algorithm, but it has some nice properties. For instance it has a halt condition, where we are guaranteed to have an optimal path. It also doesn't make unecessary explorations, i.e. explore things that couldn't possibly help it improve its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "One problem that we haven't adressed so far is the size of the optmistic world, since the agent might not know the size of the actual world. One simple way is to estabilish an \"upper bound\" where we know the optimal path would be inside. For instance if the agent completed the exploration run by visitin $n$ unique states, then the optimal path can't go farther than $n$ from the starting position. This means we could consider our optimistic world to have size $(2n+1, 2n+1)$ and have the starting position at the midle. This is by no means an optimal estimation, but it would be enough to guarantee a solution. In our case however, just to make things simple, we will pass the size of the optmistic world as a paramaters to our agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this algorithm is pretty different from others, this notebook will be a step by step implementation of it(similar in spirit to the implementation in the code base). We will look at its performance in other notebooks, but in truth there really isn't much to analyze, there are no hyperparameter or anything, it just kinda solves the problem(although there is definetily room for improvement, specially in the first episode)."
